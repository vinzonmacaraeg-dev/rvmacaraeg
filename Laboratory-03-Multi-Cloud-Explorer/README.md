# Laboratory 03 – Multi-Cloud Explorer

## Mission Overview

This laboratory activity focuses on examining and comparing three major cloud service providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It involves researching their different services and features, evaluating their capabilities, and identifying the most appropriate cloud platform for various business situations.

## Objectives

- Explore the major public cloud platforms.
- Identify core services offered by AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP.
- Compare cloud services across different providers.
- Analyze business requirements and recommend appropriate cloud solutions.
- Create professional technical documentation using Markdown.
- Continue developing a well-organized GitHub Cloud Computing Portfolio.
